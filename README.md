# NEOFIT - High-Performance Evolution Ecosystem

## 1. Project Overview
NEOFIT is not a standard gym website. It is a digital gateway to a futuristic "Biological Optimization Ecosystem." The project was designed to break away from traditional fitness branding (which often feels generic or overly rugged) and instead embrace a **High-Tech, Sci-Fi, and Premium Performance** aesthetic.

The goal is to frame fitness not just as "exercise," but as "engineering the human machine."

## 2. Design Philosophy & Aesthetic
The visual language is built around the concept of **"The Machine"**:
*   **Dark Mode Core**: A deep, almost black background (`#050505`) creates a sleek, premium, and immersive atmosphere, mimicking the interface of advanced software or a command center.
*   **Cyan Energy**: The primary accent color (`#00e5ff`) represents energy, electricity, and bio-data. It is used sparingly to draw attention to critical calls-to-action (CTAs) and data points.
*   **Glassmorphism**: Translucent panels with blur effects (`backdrop-filter`) are used for cards and forms. This adds depth and modernity, making UI elements feel like floating data screens.
*   **Typography**:
    *   **Syne**: Used for headings. It’s wide, bold, and unique, giving a confident and unconventional look.
    *   **Outfit**: Used for numbers and data. It feels digital and precise.
    *   **Inter**: Used for body text. It is highly readable and clean.

## 3. Technology Stack
The project is built on a robust, lightweight foundation to ensure speed and universally compatible performance:
*   **HTML5**: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
*   **CSS3**:
    *   **CSS Variables**: For consistent theming (colors, spacing).
    *   **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: For complex, responsive layouts that adapt to any screen size.
    *   **Animations**: Keyframes for radar scans and hover effects.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight logic for:
    *   Navbar scroll effects (glass transition).
    *   Scroll-on-reveal animations.
    *   Mobile menu toggling.
    *   Modal interactions (Message/Success popups).

## 4. Site Architecture & Features

### Core Pages
*   **`index.html` (Command Center)**: The landing page. Introduces the holistic vision, showing elite disciplines, pricing tiers, and success stories. It acts as the central hub.
*   **`performance.html` (The Lab)**: Focuses on the data and science. Features animated bar charts, biometric data cards, and the technical methodology behind the training.
*   **`team.html` (Elite Command)**: Showcases the coaches. Instead of "trainers," they are "specialists" and "scientists," reinforcing the expert-led nature of the brand.
*   **`program.html` (The Blueprint)**: Details the training phases. It breaks down the 12-week cycle and offers a micro-cycle view of a sample week.
*   **`contact.html` (Secure Uplink)**: Rebranding "Contact Us" to "Uplink." Features a radar animation and a "Transmission" form to maintain immersion.
*   **`join.html` (Initiation)**: The sign-up page. Designed to feel like entering a secure contract with a high-end agency.
*   **`start.html` (Activation)**: A post-decision page that simulates "System Initialization," guiding the user through their first inputs before confirming membership.

### Key Interactive Elements
*   **Responsive Navigation**: Seamlessly adapts from a desktop horizontal menu to a full-screen mobile overlay.
*   **Success Modals**: Custom-built popups that appear upon form submission, confirming actions like "Transmission Sent" or "System Active" without page reloads.
*   **Interactive FAQ**: An accordion-style protocol database on the Uplink page.

## 5. Mobile Responsiveness
The site follows a **"Mobile-Refined"** approach. While the desktop view offers expansive grids, the mobile view utilizes:
*   **Vertical Stacking**: Grids transform into single-column layouts for readability.
*   **Touch Targets**: Buttons and inputs are sized for easy tapping.
*   **Horizontal Scroll Prevention**: Strict overflow management ensures the layout remains stable on all devices.

## 6. How to Run
Since this is a static site, no backend server or compilation is required.
1.  Open the project folder.
2.  Double-click `index.html` to launch it in your default web browser.
